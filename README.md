# Auto story for E7!

Hi! I just realized that I was bored doing manually the story of E7, so I decided to create a bot that does it. Please let me know if you want me to improve it or if there is bug in the program, feel free to improve it

#  How to run it ?
Ps : This is for windows, if you use linux you probably can just fix it for yourself :)
You need to have a window called "Epic Seven", I didn't try but I think it only works with the Strove app 
I might add an .exe file, I know it sounds crazy but I think it's the easiest option if you don't have python on your computer (not done yet so use python)

just run the main.py
# Important informations
* The bot use your leaves, but if you don't have, it's going to use your skystones, so take care about it
* It might get stuck if you are full with gear/artefacts/heroes
* This is taking control of the mouse, so sadly it's not possible to do anything at the same time and it can be annoying to stop. I usually do my bot without but now with security in the apps, I didn't manage to make it click without using the mouse
